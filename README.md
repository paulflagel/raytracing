# Raytracing

Clone this repo and then :

```
cd raytracing
make
./raytracer
```

This will generate a file called `image.png`, and a `build` directory.

To clean everything : 
```
make clean
```

### Troubleshooting
If the compiler `g++-11` isn't suppported on your machine, change it in the makefile.

Else, open an issue.
